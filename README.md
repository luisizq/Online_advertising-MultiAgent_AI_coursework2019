# multi-agent_ai_2019
This is the coursework for the group assignment of COMP0124 Multi-agent AI @UCL 2019

We have divided the whole work in x different python notebooks.

## Notebooks overview:


### Problem 1 & 3: CTR_Prediction

Here we do all the initial Data Exploration. In the second part of the notebook we code all the parts for the CTR_Prediction: Logistic Regression, Feature selection and Random Forest model

### Problem 2: Basic_Strategies

In this notebook we analyse the first naives strategies: constant bidding for 1 agent, random bidding for 1 agent and random bidding for multiple agents.

### Problem 3 & 4: Bidding_Strategies

In this notebook we develop different strategies, ranging from the Linear Strategy to Non-Linear Strategies such as the Square ,Exponential bidding and ORTB bidding strategy. We also create all the necessary plots

### Problem 5: Multi-agent_Two-agents

Here we analyse a the a game-theory based system: 2 agents with linear strategies. We analyse the Nash Equilibria of the system.

### Problem 5: Multi-agent_Mixed-Strategy

Here we create a framework for analysis over multiple agents, in this case, 76. We analyse the results after agents make their biddings and find the best strategy.
